# neovim-tmux-config
this is my config for tmux and neovim. I will make it a point to clean them up and add comments so a user will better understand what they are adding. This editor is specifically set up for my work flow and operates very similar to how you would expect a modern code editor to operate. 

PLEASE NOTE: My configuration intends for you to run NVIM and tmux together.

## NeoVim instructions
add the NVIM config to ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
You will need to ensure you follow instructions to setup of plug https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
once you have installed plug and add this configuration just run :pluginInstall in NVIM

## TMUX Instructions
add tmux config to ~/.tmux.conf
